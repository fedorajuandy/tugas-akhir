# Face Generator

## Description

### About

A simple application to generate human face images with the limitation of the algorithm, dataset, hardware specification, and other outside variables.

![UI](/img/ui.png)

1. "Text prompt" textbox ,to enter text description of desired image
2. "Gender" radio button, to choose desired gender
3. "Attributes" checkboxes, to choose whether to include certain attributes or not
4. "RUN" button (or keyboard ENTER button), to confirm input
5. Result placeholder, the place for generated image

### Notes

- Loading and saving models are configured for training from scratch only
- Loading and saving models are configured to my own use; change them to your suitable one
- Optimisation only using Distributed Shampoo
- The dataset is limited to CelebA-HQ

### Dependencies

Main:

- python >=3.7
- gradio
- transformers
- einops
- unidecode
- ftfy
- emoji
- pillow
- jax

## Guide

### How to use

Users input either free-form text in the textbox or choose one or several attribute options in the form of radio buttons and checkboxes then press the RUN or ENTER button to confirm them. Then the user waits until the desired image is generated and shown in the previously empty placeholder.
